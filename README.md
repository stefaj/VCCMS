# VCCMS
Virtual Concierge Creator and Management System

##Background
Visitors to multi-building premises and large buildings find it difficult to navigate without the assistance of a concierge. 
Virtual concierges do exist to help visitors with navigation, but existing virtual concierges limit users to a single building, and do not allow navigation to other buildings on the premises.

Most existing virtual concierges are user-friendly but are pose a bad experience to manage, maintain or create a virtual concierge from the developer and administrator's side.

The current problem is not the inherent idea of virtual concierges, but rather the development and maintenance of virtual concierge systems.

There is a need for maintainable, manageable and expandable virtual concierges.
From the administrator's side, it can be difficult and time-consuming to change destination names on the virtual concierge.
